# Linear Search Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the linear search algorithm in C. It searches for a key element in an array by sequentially checking each element until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the C file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Algorithm Description

The linear search algorithm iterates through each element of the array and compares it with the key element. If a match is found, the algorithm returns the index of the element. If the key element is not found, the algorithm returns -1.

## Time Complexity

The linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. It is suitable for small-sized arrays or unsorted data where efficiency is not a primary concern.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int key) {
    // Implementation of linear search algorithm
    // ...
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of the linear search algorithm
    // ...
}
